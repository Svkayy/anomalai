# anomalai
AnomalAI is a modular system for detecting safety hazards in real-world environments using cv, ml, AI and RAG. The input can be any live video feed (e.g., from AR glasses, CCTV cameras, or mobile devices). The system processes the stream, identifies potential unsafe conditions, and generates structured reports for users and supervisors.
